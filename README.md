# AUhacks2021
Auburn University Hackathon 2021
Please visit our domain at https://orbitalowl.tech/

We decided to embrace our limited computer science knowledge and make tools for people to learn a topic we enjoy. The tool we created is called Orbital Owl, this website gives the user information on how satellite orbits are shaped and the basis of the formation. We also provided the user with a interactive web app designed and built in MATLAB. This simulation tool is an accurate model accounting for two-body dynamics and J2 perturbations. 

In this git you will find individual files for the orbit simulation functions and an installer for a dedicated desktop app. This is not a required download as the simulation is also hosted on the domain. 

We did our best, 
Aerospace bois out.
