We decided to embrace our limited computer science knowledge and make tools for people to learn a topic we enjoy. The tool we created is called Orbital Owl, this website gives the user information on how satellite orbits are shaped and the basis of the formation. We also provided the user with a interactive web app designed and built in MATLAB. This simulation tool is an accurate model accounting for two-body dynamics and J2 perturbations.
